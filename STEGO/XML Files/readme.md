### N o T e S

The file given seems to be an XML file used for some software. I searched on google " " to hopefully find the tool that uses the same XML scheme. From this, I find that this file is used by "Logisim" (http://www.cburch.com/logisim/index.html).

After downloading the tool and loading the given file (change file extension to all file to import the given file), we see a circuit board with 4 * 7 switch on the top and a single digit panel in the center. From the prompt, we can assume we need to turn on some of the switches in order make a number "4" display in the panel.
